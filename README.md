# Ultimate Tiles, Tile Assistant

This web app was created as an extension for work purposes to add features to assist employees in information & calculations at Ultimate Tiles Mornington.

Users have the ability to perform calculations that they may need to quantify for customers such as how much Grout a customer would need for their job or how many
coping tiles required for a perimeter of an area (pool).

Users can also have access to documentation about products or about how to use company related software.

The application uses a Tree Directory Structure with a DFS algorithm for navigation of directories.

The site is written in asp.net, JavaScript, & razorpages. It is currently being hosted on Azure app service.
